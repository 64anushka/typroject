SALES ANALYTICS: A STATISTICAL APPROACH TOWARDS OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS

In this project we have analyzed the sales data provided to us by two shops-a pharmaceutical shop and the other a departmental store using different statistical techniques.

The main aim of our project is to help small businesses monitor their sales and to pinpoint new opportunities to grow their business and discern areas where 
there can be possible scope for improvement. By using various techniques, we hope to aid in providing them actionable solutions.

We have done an in depth analysis of sales using statistical tools like Time Series Analysis, Markov Chains and Optimization Techniques.
Additionally, mathematical models have been made for profit, discount and inventory to provide insights into the performance of their business.
